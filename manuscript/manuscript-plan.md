# Introduction

**Par1**:  

- Predator prey interactions are important  for community and ecosystem dynamics
- Predator-prey interactions are implicitly dynamic, and it is assumed that feedback mechanisms drive the behaviour of predators and prey. For instance...(give some examples of reciprocal behavioural plasticity?)
- Yet, empirically, behavioural interactions have mostly been modeled from a static point of view, and the proximate mechanisms involved in feedbacks processes are poorly understood.
- One of the reasons is that it is particularily difficult to observe and measure direct interactions, and there is no general framework readiliy available for scientists to model such feedback processes. Moreover, assessing whether the predator or the prey drives the direction of the reciprocal behavioural adjustments adds an additional layer of complexity, which hinders our ability to predict how ecological communities should be structured through time.

**Par2**:  

- Early studies have showed that... (talk about feedbacks and theoretical models)
- explain how prey answer to predation (reduced activity, etc.)

**Par3**:  

- Predator features that can shape the interaction
- Predators increase their success with experience
- They also become specialized or flexible throughout repeated interactions with their prey

**Par4**
- What we did here, explain the causal model
- include figure of the graph
